Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that allows glucose to enter the cells where it will be turned into energy. Insulin resistance -means you are a patient of Type 2 diabetes. Insulin resistance is the condition in which normal amounts of insulin are inadequate to produce a normal insulin response from fat, muscle and liver cells.

Coal is formed from ancient plant material accumulating over long periods of time in swamp conditions so devoid of oxygen that bacteria could not exist to cause decay. Being composed almost entirerly of plant fossils, coal is in effect concentrated sunlight, and is one of our most important fossil fuels. The United States as a whole has more recoverable coal resources than any other country on the planet-- over 262 billion tons-- enough to last over 200 years!\\n']\n"
